Good morning everyone!
This weeks challenge is to create a Web Broswer View.
You will want to create a view that has the following: a text field, a
back button, a go button, a forward button and a webview.
The go button will obviously trigger the website that is entered into
the texfield to be loaded into the webview.
The back and forward buttons will clearly navigate backwards and
forwards while updating the textfield with the current corresponding
URL.

Feel free to use storyboards/nibs or objective-c/swift when going about
completing the challenge!
GitHub/BitBucket links of projects are encouraged so everyone can share
their solutions and discuss different approaches.
When uploading your readme to github or whichever service you choose,
please link back to this page if you can, just so if anyone sees it they
will possibly come back here and we can keep building up this community!
:)
If you have any questions, feel free to ask or hit me up on Twitter
[@sdoowhsoj](https://twitter.com/sdoowhsoj).
Look forward to seeing what you guys come up with!
